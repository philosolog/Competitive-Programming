# About
This is basically an archive of my solutions to various competitive programming sites.

# Layout
> Currently in-progress solutions are created within this README's parent directory.

`../bin` exists to house my temporary testcase information.

`../Solutions` contains the code to accepted solutions I've worked through.

`../Templates` has code templates I may use for some problems (usually for libraries).

`../Unsolved` holds problems that I've taken a break from.

# Goodbye
So yeah, this is mainly for my personal use!
