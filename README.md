# About
This is basically an archive of my solutions to various competitive programming sites.

# Layout
> Currently in-progress solutions are created within this README's parent directory.

`../bin` exists to house my temporary test case information.

`../Solutions` contains the code for the accepted solutions I've worked through.

`../Templates` has code templates I may use for some problems (usually for libraries).

`../Unsolved` holds problems that I've taken a break from.

# Contribution
If you want to improve my code, answer some questions I have, or check out my notes, feel free to check out the comments prefixed by,
- `TODO: ` (stuff I'd like to redo)
- `?: ` (questions I have)
- `!: ` (concerns/errors I've warned my future self about)
- and `Note: ` (notes for future me)

Suggesting improvements? Make an [issue](https://github.com/philosolog/Competitive-Programming/issues)/[pull](https://github.com/philosolog/Competitive-Programming/pulls) or [contact me on Discord](https://discord.com/users/897728576659529780)!

I plan on looking back on those points.. someday!

# Goodbye
So yeah, this is mainly for my personal use!
